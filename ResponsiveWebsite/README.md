MAD9013-f19 Midterm Project  
# Responsive Website
**Due before 11:59 am on Friday, October 18, 2019**

Don't leave this to the last minute. Start _at least_ one week in advance!

## Starter Repo
A repository with the starting code for this assignment is available on GitHub. It contains an HTML file, and image file and a CSS file. **Do NOT edit the HTML.** All of your work on this project should be done in the CSS file.

### Fork the repo
- Go to https://rlmckenney.github.com/mad9013-f19-p1-starter in your browser.
- Click the **Fork** button in the top right corner of the screen. This will create a copy of the repository in your account.
- Change the settings to make your repo **private**.
- Change the settings to enable GitHub Pages.

### Clone the repo
Clone your forked repo to your laptop as you normally would.
```bash
git clone <URL-to-your-repo>
```

## Requirements
- Both Nav menus use Flexbox to make the links align.
- SubNav menu aligns to the right
- MainNav links spread out to the whole width
- The `.container` div should have a max-width of 1500px
- All the body text and links should use a sans-serif font
- All the heading text should use a serif font
- All font-family values should use font-stacks that include a google font, fallback fonts, and the `serif` or `sans-serif` font.
- All colours on the page need to use the `hsl( )` method.
- All colours should be based on a **primary** and a **secondary** hue that is used in the hsl methods.
- All font-sizes should be relatively sized using [a value that comes from a scale](https://type-scale.com).
- The first story should be styled to appear subtly more important than the other stories.
- Remember to apply consistent alignment and sizing on your page.
- Make sure you [run the validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) on your web page to ensure that your HTML is valid. (Great way to avoid problems with your CSS)
- Use of Media Queries is optional but encouraged.

### Make frequent commits.
As you complete each of the requirements above, make a commit. This will not only give you a safety net in-case you need to roll-back some changes, but show the progress of your work.

### Test, Test, Test
- Test locally as you are working.
- Don't forget to also test in GitHub Pages after you push your finished work.

## Submission
On the Assignment page in BS LMS, submit both the **github.io** URL and the **github.com** URL.
Be sure to invite GitHub user `rlmckenney` as a collaborator on your private repo, or I will not be able to view and mark your assignment.
